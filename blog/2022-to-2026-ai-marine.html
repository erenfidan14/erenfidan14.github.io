<!-- 2022-to-2026-ai-marine.html
     Fixes:
     1) Removed invalid <a> tags from <head> (was breaking markup)
     2) Uses the SAME sticky nav + theme toggle as index.html
     3) Dark mode works here (relies on your global css variables + main.js)
     4) Easy way back home + optional “Blog” anchor support
     5) Moved scripts to end of body (safer, faster)
     6) Avoids redefining :root variables that can fight your main style.css

        <h1>From 2022 to 2026: How AI Changed Marine Engineering (And My Predictions)</h1>

        <p class="lede">
          In 2022, I was a research assistant at Aalto working on "Emerging Methods in Seakeeping."
          I predicted AI/ML would revolutionize CFD and ship design. Four years later, here's what
          actually happened, what I got right, and what surprised me.
        </p>
      </header>

      <p>
        It feels strange to write this in 2026, looking back at my 2022 self—a third-year bachelor student
        at Istanbul Technical University, spending my summer at Aalto University in Espoo, Finland. I was
        working on a research report titled <strong>"Emerging Methods in Seakeeping: Bibliometric Analysis,
        Systematic Literature Review, and Future Research Directions."</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        Back then, I was convinced that AI and machine learning would completely transform naval architecture
        within 3-5 years. I wrote about deep learning for ship motion prediction, neural networks for automatic
        berthing, and digital twins becoming standard in ship design. Some of it happened. Some didn't. And
        some things I never saw coming.
      </p>

      <h2>What I Predicted in 2022</h2>

      <p>My 2022 report identified several key trends I expected to mature by 2025-2026:</p>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>Deep Learning for Ship Motion Prediction:</strong> I thought LSTM neural networks would
          replace traditional potential flow theory for real-time seakeeping predictions.</li>

        <li><strong>AI-Accelerated CFD:</strong> I predicted machine learning would reduce CFD simulation
          times from days to hours through surrogate models.</li>

        <li><strong>Digital Twins:</strong> I expected every major shipyard to have digital twin capabilities
          for real-time performance monitoring.</li>

        <li><strong>Reinforcement Learning:</strong> I wrote about DRL (Deep Reinforcement Learning) being
          used for autonomous ship maneuvering within 5 years.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>What Actually Happened (2026 Reality)</h2>

      <div class="comparison-grid">
        <section class="comparison-box box-2022">
          <h4>🎯 2022 Predictions</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>AI replaces traditional seakeeping methods</li>
            <li>CFD simulation time: hours instead of days</li>
            <li>Digital twins become industry standard</li>
            <li>Autonomous ships using DRL by 2026</li>
            <li>Cloud-based ship design platforms</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="comparison-box box-2026">
          <h4>✅ 2026 Reality</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>AI complements (not replaces) traditional methods</li>
            <li>CFD: 30-40% faster with ML surrogates</li>
            <li>Digital twins: 15% of newbuilds (not standard)</li>
            <li>Autonomous ships: still in trials</li>
            <li>Cloud design: adopted by major yards</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
      </div>

      <h3>✅ What I Got Right</h3>

      <p>
        <strong>Cloud-based design platforms</strong> did become mainstream. During my time at Turkish Airlines
        Technic in 2024, I saw how aviation was adopting cloud workflows, and shipbuilding followed. The pandemic accelerated
        this, but the shift stuck.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>ML-accelerated CFD</strong> is real, but not as revolutionary as I expected. In marine CFD,
        ML surrogates and data-driven components are useful, but the best gains often come from workflow optimization,
        meshing automation, and HPC improvements—not only models.
      </p>

      <h3>❌ What I Got Wrong</h3>

      <p>
        <strong>Deep learning didn't replace traditional methods.</strong> In 2022, I thought neural networks
        would make strip theory obsolete. Instead, they coexist. The physics-based models are still more reliable
        for certification, while ML handles optimization and real-time predictions. The marine industry is conservative—and
        for good reason when safety is involved.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Autonomous ships are further away than I thought.</strong> DRL for ship maneuvering works in
        simulations, but real-world deployment is slowed by regulation, liability, and insurance. The technology
        progresses faster than the governance.
      </p>

      <h3>🚀 What Surprised Me</h3>

      <div class="highlight-box">
        <h4>💡 The Big Surprise: Generative AI for Design</h4>
        <p>
          I never mentioned LLMs or generative AI in my 2022 report. ChatGPT didn't exist when I wrote it.
          Yet generative AI has become a major disruptor—not by replacing CFD, but by speeding up the design workflow:
          CAD copilots, automated documentation, and natural-language interfaces for simulation tools.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        Another surprise: <strong>the talent shift.</strong> In 2022, I wrote about the need for naval architects
        to learn data science. By 2026, the reverse is also true—tech teams hire domain engineers to build maritime AI.
      </p>

      <h2>What This Means for 2030</h2>

      <p>Based on what I've learned between 2022 and 2026, here are my new predictions:</p>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>Hybrid workflows will dominate.</strong> AI + physics-based models, not AI replacing physics.
          The "digital thread" connecting design, build, and operations will matter more than any single model.</li>

        <li><strong>Generative design will mature.</strong> By 2030, AI will generate candidate hull forms optimized for
          routes and operational profiles, but humans will validate, certify, and own responsibility.</li>

        <li><strong>Real-time decision support.</strong> Not fully autonomous ships, but AI-assisted route and operations
          tools for captains and fleets in real time.</li>

        <li><strong>Standardization of digital twins.</strong> Class societies will push standards that make twins as normal
          as stability documentation.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Personal Reflection</h2>

      <p>
        Reading my 2022 report today is humbling. I was enthusiastic but naive about adoption timelines. The technology moved fast;
        the industry moved slow. But shipbuilding is safety-critical; deliberate validation is rational.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        "The future is already here—it's just not evenly distributed." — William Gibson
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Working at Turkish Airlines Technic taught me that aviation often adopts faster than maritime, but both move toward the same goal:
        data-driven, optimized, sustainable operations.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now in 2026, finishing my MSc at Aalto with an Excellence Scholarship, I'm more optimistic than ever—just with more realistic expectations.
        The marine industry doesn't need disruption; it needs integration of new tools into proven workflows.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you're reading this in 2030, check back. I suspect I'll have more surprises to report.
