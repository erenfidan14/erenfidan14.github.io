        <h1 class="blog-title">From 2022 to 2026: How AI Changed Marine Engineering (And My Predictions)</h1>

        <p class="blog-lead">
          In 2022, I was a research assistant at Aalto working on “Emerging Methods in Seakeeping.”
          I predicted AI/ML would revolutionize CFD and ship design. Four years later, here’s what
          actually happened, what I got right, and what surprised me.
        </p>
      </header>

      <section class="blog-content">
        <p>
          It feels strange to write this in 2026, looking back at my 2022 self—a third-year bachelor student
          at Istanbul Technical University, spending my summer at Aalto University in Espoo, Finland. I was
          working on a research report titled <strong>“Emerging Methods in Seakeeping: Bibliometric Analysis,
          Systematic Literature Review, and Future Research Directions.”</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          Back then, I was convinced that AI and machine learning would completely transform naval architecture
          within 3–5 years. I wrote about deep learning for ship motion prediction, neural networks for automatic
          berthing, and digital twins becoming standard in ship design. Some of it happened. Some didn’t. And some
          things I never saw coming.
        </p>

        <h2>What I Predicted in 2022</h2>
        <p>My 2022 report identified several key trends I expected to mature by 2025–2026:</p>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>Deep Learning for Ship Motion Prediction:</strong> I thought LSTM neural networks would replace traditional potential flow theory for real-time seakeeping predictions.</li>
          <li><strong>AI-Accelerated CFD:</strong> I predicted machine learning would reduce CFD simulation times from days to hours through surrogate models.</li>
          <li><strong>Digital Twins:</strong> I expected every major shipyard to have digital twin capabilities for real-time performance monitoring.</li>
          <li><strong>Reinforcement Learning:</strong> I wrote about DRL being used for autonomous ship maneuvering within 5 years.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>What Actually Happened (2026 Reality)</h2>

        <div class="blog-compare">
          <div class="blog-compare-box">
            <h4>🎯 2022 Predictions</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>AI replaces traditional seakeeping methods</li>
              <li>CFD simulation time: hours instead of days</li>
              <li>Digital twins become industry standard</li>
              <li>Autonomous ships using DRL by 2026</li>
              <li>Cloud-based ship design platforms</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div class="blog-compare-box">
            <h4>✅ 2026 Reality</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>AI complements (not replaces) traditional methods</li>
              <li>CFD: 30–40% faster with ML surrogates</li>
              <li>Digital twins: ~15% of newbuilds (not standard)</li>
              <li>Autonomous ships: still in trials</li>
              <li>Cloud design: adopted by major yards</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h3>✅ What I Got Right</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Cloud-based design platforms</strong> did become mainstream. During my time at Turkish Airlines Technic
          in 2024, I saw how aviation was adopting cloud workflows, and shipbuilding followed.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>ML-accelerated CFD</strong> is real, but not as revolutionary as I expected. Useful, but not the 10× improvement I predicted.
        </p>

        <h3>❌ What I Got Wrong</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Deep learning didn’t replace traditional methods.</strong> Physics-based models remain more reliable for certification.
          ML is used heavily for optimization and near-real-time support.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Autonomous ships are further away than I thought.</strong> Real deployments are blocked mainly by regulation,
          liability, and insurance—not purely technology.
        </p>

        <div class="blog-callout">
          <h4>💡 The Big Surprise: Generative AI for Design</h4>
          <p>
            I never mentioned LLMs or generative AI in my 2022 report. ChatGPT didn’t exist when I wrote it.
            Yet generative AI became a major disruptor: AI copilots for CAD, automated documentation,
            and natural-language interfaces for simulation tools.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Personal Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          Reading my 2022 report today is humbling. The technology moved fast; adoption moved slower.
          In safety-critical industries, that delay is rational.
        </p>
