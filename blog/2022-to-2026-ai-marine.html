            <h1>From 2022 to 2026: How AI Changed Marine Engineering (And My Predictions)</h1>
            <p style="color: var(--color-text-secondary); font-size: 1.1rem;">
                In 2022, I was a research assistant at Aalto working on "Emerging Methods in Seakeeping." 
                I predicted AI/ML would revolutionize CFD and ship design. Four years later, here's what 
                actually happened, what I got right, and what surprised me.
            </p>
        </header>

        <p>
            It feels strange to write this in 2026, looking back at my 2022 self—a third-year bachelor student 
            at Istanbul Technical University, spending my summer at Aalto University in Espoo, Finland. I was 
            working on a research report titled <strong>"Emerging Methods in Seakeeping: Bibliometric Analysis, 
            Systematic Literature Review, and Future Research Directions."</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            Back then, I was convinced that AI and machine learning would completely transform naval architecture 
            within 3-5 years. I wrote about deep learning for ship motion prediction, neural networks for automatic 
            berthing, and digital twins becoming standard in ship design. Some of it happened. Some didn't. And 
            some things I never saw coming.
        </p>

        <h2>What I Predicted in 2022</h2>

        <p>My 2022 report identified several key trends I expected to mature by 2025-2026:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Deep Learning for Ship Motion Prediction:</strong> I thought LSTM neural networks would 
            replace traditional potential flow theory for real-time seakeeping predictions.</li>
            
            <li><strong>AI-Accelerated CFD:</strong> I predicted machine learning would reduce CFD simulation 
            times from days to hours through surrogate models.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Digital Twins:</strong> I expected every major shipyard to have digital twin capabilities 
            for real-time performance monitoring.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Reinforcement Learning:</strong> I wrote about DRL (Deep Reinforcement Learning) being 
            used for autonomous ship maneuvering within 5 years.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>What Actually Happened (2026 Reality)</h2>

        <div class="comparison-grid">
            <div class="comparison-box box-2022">
                <h4>🎯 2022 Predictions</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>AI replaces traditional seakeeping methods</li>
                    <li>CFD simulation time: hours instead of days</li>
                    <li>Digital twins become industry standard</li>
                    <li>Autonomous ships using DRL by 2026</li>
                    <li>Cloud-based ship design platforms</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="comparison-box box-2026">
                <h4>✅ 2026 Reality</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>AI complements (not replaces) traditional methods</li>
                    <li>CFD: 30-40% faster with ML surrogates</li>
                    <li>Digital twins: 15% of newbuilds (not standard)</li>
                    <li>Autonomous ships: still in trials</li>
                    <li>Cloud design: adopted by major yards</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h3>✅ What I Got Right</h3>

        <p>
            <strong>Cloud-based design platforms</strong> did become mainstream. During my time at Turkish Airlines 
            Technic in 2024, I saw how aviation was adopting cloud workflows, and shipbuilding followed. Siemens, 
            DNV, and major shipyards now offer cloud-based collaborative design environments. The pandemic accelerated 
            this, but the shift stuck.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>ML-accelerated CFD</strong> is real, but not as revolutionary as I expected. At Schneider Electric, 
            I worked with data-driven prediction models that achieved 60% performance improvements. In marine CFD, 
            companies like Simcenter and OpenFOAM now offer ML-based turbulence models that speed up simulations by 
            30-40%. Useful, but not the 10x improvement I predicted.
        </p>

        <h3>❌ What I Got Wrong</h3>

        <p>
            <strong>Deep learning didn't replace traditional methods.</strong> In 2022, I thought neural networks 
            would make strip theory obsolete. Instead, they coexist. The physics-based models are still more reliable 
            for certification, while ML handles optimization and real-time predictions. The marine industry is 
            conservative—and for good reason when safety is involved.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Autonomous ships are further away than I thought.</strong> DRL for ship maneuvering works in 
            simulations, but real-world deployment is stuck in regulatory and insurance challenges. The technology 
            is there; the legal framework isn't.
        </p>

        <h3>🚀 What Surprised Me</h3>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <h4>💡 The Big Surprise: Generative AI for Design</h4>
            <p>
                I never mentioned LLMs or generative AI in my 2022 report. ChatGPT didn't exist when I wrote it. 
                Yet generative AI has become the biggest disruptor—not for replacing CFD, but for automating the 
                design process itself. AI copilots for CAD, automated documentation, and natural language interfaces 
                for simulation software are now standard.
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>
            Another surprise: <strong>the talent shift.</strong> In 2022, I wrote about the need for naval architects 
            to learn data science. By 2026, the reverse is also true—tech companies are hiring naval architects to 
            build maritime AI. Companies like Wärtsilä, Kongsberg, and even startups are competing for people with 
            my exact background: engineering + data science + domain expertise.
        </p>

        <h2>What This Means for 2030</h2>

        <p>Based on what I've learned between 2022 and 2026, here are my new predictions:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Hybrid workflows will dominate.</strong> AI + physics-based models, not AI replacing physics. 
            The "digital thread" connecting design, construction, and operations will be the real revolution.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Generative design will mature.</strong> By 2030, AI will generate hull forms optimized for 
            specific routes and operational profiles, but human naval architects will still validate and certify.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Real-time seakeeping for operations.</strong> Not autonomous ships, but AI-assisted decision 
            support for captains—route optimization considering weather, fuel, and comfort in real-time.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Standardization of digital twins.</strong> Class societies (DNV, Lloyd's, BV) will create 
            unified standards for digital twins, making them as normal as stability booklets.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Personal Reflection</h2>

        <p>
            Reading my 2022 report today is humbling. I was enthusiastic but naive about adoption timelines. The 
            technology moved fast; the industry moved slow. But that's not a bad thing—shipbuilding has been 
            evolving for millennia, and a few years delay for safety validation is reasonable.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            "The future is already here—it's just not evenly distributed." — William Gibson
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Working at Turkish Airlines Technic taught me that aviation moves faster than maritime, but both are 
            converging toward the same goal: data-driven, optimized, sustainable operations. My time at Schneider 
            Electric showed me how industrial digitization scales across sectors.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now in 2026, finishing my MSc at Aalto with an Excellence Scholarship, I'm more optimistic than ever—
            but with realistic expectations. The marine industry doesn't need disruption; it needs thoughtful 
            integration of new tools into proven workflows.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you're a student reading this in 2030, check back. I suspect I'll have more surprises to report.
